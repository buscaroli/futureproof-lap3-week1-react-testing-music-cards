## Technologies 📡

- React (JS library to build UI)
- React Hooks:
  - useState (to work with each components' state)
  - useEffect (to mimic life-cycle events)
  - useNavigate (to harness the Browser's history object to navigate back to the previous page)
- React-router (to have multiple page in a single-page app)
- CSS-modules (for organised styling)
- Jest (as a test runner)
- React testing library (RTL - for the tests)
- Axios (to make fetch requests, smarter than fetch and isomorphic (can be used FE and BE))
- UUID (npm package used to generate uuids, Universally Unique Identifiers)

## Challenges 😫

- Testing (struggle to use mocks with Jest)
